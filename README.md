# BIxxReader

A very basic extension that allows you to view a summary of bi** files, which are exports from BI software.

## Running during development

- Open this example in VS Code 1.46+
- `npm install`
- `F5` to start debugging

Open the example files from the `exampleFiles` directory.

## TODO:

- Add [virtual document] support for editing, as that seems like it will be the better way to implement the JSON editing
- Add example files to the repository
- Add tests
- Add build
- Publish to the gallery
- Add Outline Support / some form of fast navigation to the WebView
